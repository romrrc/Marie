      <td colspan="4" align="center">Marie Curie, born Maria Salomea Skłodowska on November 7, 1867 in Warsaw, Poland, was a pioneering physicist and chemist. She moved to Paris in 1891 to study at the Sorbonne, where she earned degrees in physics and mathematics. In 1895, she married Pierre Curie, with whom she began groundbreaking research on radioactivity, a term she herself coined. Together, they discovered two new elements, polonium and radium, in 1898, which revolutionized the scientific understanding of atomic structure.</td>

      <td colspan="4" align="center">Her achievements were recognized globally: in 1903, Marie and Pierre Curie shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with Henri Becquerel for their work on radioactivity. After Pierre&rsquo;s tragic death in 1906, Marie continued her research independently, becoming the first woman to teach at the Sorbonne. In 1911, she won a second Nobel Prize, this time in Chemistry, for her isolation of pure radium. She remains the only person to have won Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields.</td>
