      <td colspan="4" align="center"><p><strong>Marie Curie&rsquo;s contributions to humanity were groundbreaking, reshaping both science and medicine.</strong> She is best remembered for her discovery of the elements <strong>polonium and radium in 1898</strong>, which opened the door to the study of radioactivity, a term she herself coined. This work not only earned her and Pierre Curie the <strong>Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903</strong>, but also laid the foundation for modern nuclear science.</p>
        <p>Her second major achievement came in <strong>1911</strong>, when she was awarded the <strong>Nobel Prize in Chemistry</strong> for successfully isolating pure radium. This made her the <strong>first person ever to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields</strong>, a distinction she still holds today. Her research fundamentally changed how scientists understood atomic structure and energy, paving the way for advances in nuclear physics and chemistry.</p>
      <p>Beyond theoretical science, Curie&rsquo;s work had immense practical impact. During <strong>World War I</strong>, she developed mobile X-ray units known as <em>&ldquo;Little Curies&rdquo;</em>, which were used on battlefields to diagnose injuries and save countless lives. She also championed the medical use of radiation, leading to treatments for cancer and other diseases. Despite the personal cost—her prolonged exposure to radiation ultimately caused her death in 1934—Marie Curie&rsquo;s legacy endures as a symbol of scientific courage and as a pioneer whose discoveries continue to benefit humanity.</p></td>
